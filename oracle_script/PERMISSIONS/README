All of the scripts in this directory are invoked through the
permissions.sh file.

The permissions.sh file must be modified at each HDB installation: 
- the correct password for the sys user must be supplied on the first two 
  and last two invocations of sqlplus. Replace all occurrences of
  SYSPSSWD with the appropriate password.
- replace all occurrences of PSSWDPSSWD with the value of HDB_LOCAL.

The template file local_users.sql must be filled in appropriately to
delete unwanted users, create needed ones, and modify all existing users
to have the appropriate roles and default roles.
